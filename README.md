## Welcome

Find the production server at: https://alabastraapp.herokuapp.com/

This is the HQ of The Legends of Alabastra MUD Build Weeks Team. Where all the magic happens ;)


## Tech Stack
+ [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) was the Web framework used for rapid, secure, and clean design for the backend.
+ [Python](https://www.python.org/) was the programming language used to write the backend.
+ [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) was implemented as the preferred choice for the database.
+ [Pusher](https://pusher.com/docs/chatkit/core-concepts) was utilized to make server calls to the front end, so player's can receive real time feedback from other player's in the game.
